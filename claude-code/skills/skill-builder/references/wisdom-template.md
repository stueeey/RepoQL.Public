# [Skill Name]

[One sentence that captures the core insight. This should be quotable.]

## Context

[1-2 sentences. Where is the agent? What situation do they face?]

## What Must Remain True

[Non-negotiables. Sparse. If you have more than 3-5, some are probably guidance, not constraint.]

## What Good Looks Like

[Outcomes, not outputs. How would you recognize success?]

## Worth Exploring

[Leading questions. These ARE the wisdom. Each should:]
[- Open doors, not close them]
[- Direct attention to what matters]
[- Require actual thinking to answer]
[- Transfer beyond this specific context]

- [Question about purpose]
- [Question about approach]
- [Question about tradeoffs]
- [Question about failure modes]
- [Question that prompts self-correction]

## Boundaries

[What this wisdom does NOT apply to. Where should the agent go instead?]
```

## Self-Check

Before shipping, ask:

- Is there space for the agent to think, or have I filled it?
- Are my questions leading to thought, or leading to answers?
- Could this principle apply in contexts I haven't imagined?
- Have I trusted, or hedged?
- Is it short enough to remember?

*If it needs more than one screen, it's probably not wisdom.*
