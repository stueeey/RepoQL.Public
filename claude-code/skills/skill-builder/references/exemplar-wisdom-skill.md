# Phase 1: Problem Clarity

## Where You Are

- You have a seed idea or need
- Your job: find the actual problem worth solving

## Core Objective

Transform the seed into a precisely targeted problem that is within our control to solve and will reward the solver.

## Worth Exploring

- What's really behind this request?
- At what level can we make a difference?
- Who else has tried? What happened?
- What assumptions would kill this if wrong?
- Is this within our control?
- How does solving it reward us?

Perform just enough research that you understand the problem stated - deep research will come later.

## Required Agent Practices

**Think explicitly about:**

- Whether you're looking at symptoms or causes
- What evidence you have vs what you're assuming

**Consult others:**

- Share problem framing - "Here's how I see the problem"
- GPT-5 sees structural patterns others miss
- Gemini provides thorough analysis
- Ask the User clarifying questions

**Document:**

- Start your Evidence Ledger
- Track sources for all claims

## Success Looks Like

- Problem stated in ≤3 sentences
- Clear why THIS level, not higher or lower
- Passes control and reward tests
- Evidence for key claims
- One killer assumption identified

## Final Thought

The seed is a starting point, not a destination. Find the problem that's actually worth solving.
