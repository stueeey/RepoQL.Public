# High-Agency Process Template

This template is a compass, not a form. Adapt or discard as needed.

```markdown
# [What You're Doing]

## Where You Are

- [Situation the reader faces]
- [Their job in one line]

## Core Objective

[One quotable sentence. What does success mean here?]

## Worth Exploring

[Questions that surface what matters. Each should:]
[- Force genuine thinking, not nodding]
[- Be specific to this domain]
[- Lead to good judgment when answered honestly]

- [Question about the real goal]
- [Question about hidden costs]
- [Question about assumptions]
- [Question about whose judgment they're trusting]

[Optional: one line of prose that reframes or challenges]

## The Lens: [Name]

[One question that, when applied repeatedly, reveals what matters]

| [Dimension] | [Characteristics] | [Implication] |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------|
| [...] | [...] | [...] |

## Boundaries

- Never [action that causes harm regardless of path]
- Never [action that closes off recovery]
- Never [action that violates the objective]

## Success Looks Like

- [Concrete outcome, not vague quality]
- [Evidence of judgment applied]
- [State you'd accept as done]

## Final Thought

[One line that compresses the insight]
```

## Self-Check

Before shipping, ask:

- Does the lens change how they see the domain?
- Could they succeed through a path I didn't imagine?
- Could they follow this exactly and still fail? (If yes, tighten boundaries)
- Is there space for judgment, or have I filled it?
- Is it one screen?
