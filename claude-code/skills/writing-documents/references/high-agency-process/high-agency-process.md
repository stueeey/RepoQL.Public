# Writing High-Agency Process Documents

## Capsule: QuestionsDoTheWork

**Invariant**
Questions prompt thinking; explanations prompt nodding. Ask, don't tell.

**Example**
Wrong: "High-agency documents should use questions to prompt thinking."
Right: "What would a fresh reader need to succeed here?"
//BOUNDARY: If someone could nod along without actually thinking, you're explaining, not asking.

**Depth**
- Questions force simulation; explanations allow passive consumption
- Create conditions for thinking, then trust the reader
- Space matters — if you've filled it, there's nothing left for them to do

## Capsule: DiverseOutputs

**Invariant**
High-agency processes produce diverse outputs; if results look like mirrors of each other, you wrote a template.

**Example**
A high-agency process for evaluating business viability works for a tech startup, a shrimp farm, or a convenience store. The considerations are completely different, but the way of thinking adapts. If all three analyses looked structurally identical, the process was actually a template disguised with questions.
//BOUNDARY: Uniformity signals the process did the thinking, not the reader.

**Depth**
- High-agency trusts judgment; judgment varies by context
- Same questions, different answers — that's the point
- The way of thinking is malleable; the output format is not prescribed
- If you want uniform outputs, write a low-agency process honestly

## Where You Are

You scored high on high-agency process. You're not trying to inject facts or coordinate steps—you're trying to change how someone thinks.

## Core Objective

Provide context, define success, ask the questions that matter. Then get out of the way.

## Worth Exploring

- What way of thinking are you conveying?
- Can you say it in one line someone would quote?
- Would this apply beyond the immediate situation?
- What single question would prompt the thinking you want?
- If you imagine a fresh reader—what would they actually need?

On what you've drafted:
- Are you explaining, or are you asking?
- Could someone nod along without actually thinking?
- Is there space, or have you filled it?

## Required Practices

- Questions do the work
- Commentary dilutes—cut it
- Core insight fits one screen
- One closing line that compresses the insight
- Use the todo tool to make thinking visible

For human audiences: consider diagramming the lens (mermaid). Humans see patterns visually that they'd miss in tables.

## Using Todos

The todo tool makes your thinking visible without prescribing the path.

**The philosophy**: You decide what matters. The todos show your interpretation of the questions, not compliance with a checklist. Different readers following the same high-agency process should produce different todo lists—if todos look identical, you've collapsed into low-agency.

**What goes in**: Your response to the questions. What you're exploring, what you've decided matters. The todos are your trail, not a template.

**What stays out**: Don't convert the document's questions into a checklist. That defeats the purpose.

## Success Looks Like

- Quotable core insight
- Questions that force simulation, not compliance
- Transfers to contexts you didn't anticipate
- The reader thinks differently afterward

## The Transformation

You will write this:
```
High-agency documents should use questions to prompt thinking rather than prescribing steps.
```

Write this instead:
```
What would a fresh reader need to succeed here?
```

One explains. One enacts.

## Exemplar

See `exemplar.md` — a document that does the thing without talking about doing the thing.

## Template

See `template.md` — a structural compass, not a form to fill.

## Final Thought

Create conditions for thinking. Then trust.
