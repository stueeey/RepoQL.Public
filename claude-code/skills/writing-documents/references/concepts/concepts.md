# Writing Concept Documents

Concepts are capsules. Read `capsules.md` in full before writing.

## Worth Exploring

- What truth did you learn that would change how someone thinks?
- Can you say it in one line?
- What concrete example makes it click?
- Where does this NOT apply?

On what you've drafted:
- Would someone quote your invariant?
- Does the example carry the weight, or does it need the invariant explained?
- Have you stated the boundary, or left it to be misapplied?

## When to Write a Capsule

| Capsule | Not capsule |
|---------|-------------|
| Changes how someone thinks | Changes what someone knows |
| "Wrong info is worse than missing" | API parameter reference |
| "Primacy frames interpretation" | How to configure logging |

## The Work

Read `capsules.md`. Apply it.

*If you can't compress it to one line, you may not understand it yet.*
