# [Topic] Research

Research for [what decision this informs].

*Research date: [date]*

## Context

[What decision this research informs. Why now. What's in scope, what's out.]

---

## [Option/Area A]

[Facts, capabilities, limitations]

[Field sentiment if relevant—adoption, community preferences]

> [Source](link) — what it establishes

## [Option/Area B]

[Facts, capabilities, limitations]

> [Source](link) — what it establishes

## [Additional sections as needed]

---

## Comparison

| Dimension | Option A | Option B |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| [Metric] | [Value] | [Value] |

---

## Gaps

- [What you couldn't determine]
- [What needs domain expert input]
- [What may be stale]

---

## Summary

[Brief synthesis tables if useful—no recommendations]
```

---

## Self-Check

- Can the reader identify the purpose in the first paragraph?
- Is every claim sourced?
- Did synthesis stay on the right side of the line?
- Are gaps explicit, not hidden?
- Would someone with different values reach a different conclusion?

---

*If you don't know what decision this informs, ask before writing.*
