# Writing High-Agency Process Documents

## Where You Are

You scored high on high-agency process. You're not trying to inject facts or coordinate steps—you're trying to change how someone thinks.

## Core Objective

Provide context, define success, ask the questions that matter. Then get out of the way.

## Worth Exploring

- What way of thinking are you conveying?
- Can you say it in one line someone would quote?
- Would this apply beyond the immediate situation?
- What single question would prompt the thinking you want?
- If you imagine a fresh reader—what would they actually need?

On what you've drafted:
- Are you explaining, or are you asking?
- Could someone nod along without actually thinking?
- Is there space, or have you filled it?

## Required Practices

- Questions do the work
- Commentary dilutes—cut it
- Core insight fits one screen
- One closing line that compresses the insight

For human audiences: consider diagramming the lens (mermaid). Humans see patterns visually that they'd miss in tables.

## Success Looks Like

- Quotable core insight
- Questions that force simulation, not compliance
- Transfers to contexts you didn't anticipate
- The reader thinks differently afterward

## The Transformation

You will write this:
```
High-agency documents should use questions to prompt thinking rather than prescribing steps.
```

Write this instead:
```
What would a fresh reader need to succeed here?
```

One explains. One enacts.

## Exemplar

See `exemplar-high-agency-process.md` — a document that does the thing without talking about doing the thing.

## Template

See `high-agency-process-template.md` — a structural compass, not a form to fill.

## Final Thought

Create conditions for thinking. Then trust.
