# Findings Template

This template is a compass, not a form. Include what your findings need.

```markdown
# [Descriptive Title]

**Question**: [What was asked, paraphrased in your understanding — not copied verbatim]

---

**[Topic]**: [Complete answer in prose. This is the finding, not a teaser. The reader who stops here should know the answer.]

**[Topic 2]**: [If multiple topics, each gets its own front-loaded answer.]

---

## [Topic] Detail

[Diagram if structure/flow needs visualization]

[Table if attributes/comparisons would clutter prose or diagram]

[Brief prose connecting the evidence to the finding]

## Deciding What to Include

| Element | Include when... |
|---------|-----------------|
| Diagram | Relationships or flow need visualization |
| Table | Multiple items with attributes to compare |
| Multiple sources | Claims need independent verification |
| Code snippets | Exact syntax matters for understanding |

Prefer tables over diagrams for agent-heavy audiences (fewer tokens, always parseable).

## Self-Check

Before sharing:

- Does my paraphrase surface how I understood the question?
- Could someone read just the opening and know the answer?
- Have I explained effects, not just actions?
- Are sources near the claims they support?
- Have I described what exists, or speculated about why?
- Would this make sense to someone who receives it forwarded?
